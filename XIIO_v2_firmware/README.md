This is another update to DOBOZ's XIIO firmware - this one turns Switch Output 2 into a CV (not v/oct) PWM source. This can either be filtered into a pure dc-CV, or left as PWM for some bizarreness. 

Either way, SW2 now has modes 4,5 and 6, which are cv outputs of either the keyboard, or sw2. Ascending numbers equals more smoothed. 

Have at it! I'm now going to play this a bunch and see what's broken.
